      <section class="text">
        <p>I'm a native New Yorker currently residing in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. I just started my career in Journalism this year with my enrollment at the Newmark J-School. I have a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from CUNY Queens and spent the last
          5 years working as an Ad Buyer for TV and Social Media. </p>
        <p>Though I'm still new to the field, I intend to focus my Journalism on Arts and Culture. Music has been a lifelong passion of mine and I'm excited to take on another aspect of the industry by learning how to write about it. </p>
